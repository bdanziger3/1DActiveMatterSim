"""
Particle Struct to hold a particle with its spin and velocity.

Particle is currently a point particle with no size or mass.

# Arguments
- `x::Real`: Current location of the particle on a 1D grid. Absolute and non-periodid`x \\in \\Reals`

- `s::Int8`: Initial spin (direction) of particle. S âˆˆ {1, -1} `S \\in 1`

- `v0::Real`: Initial velocity (in direction S). `v0 \\ge 0`

- `T::Real`: Characteristic time of the particle changing spin.
Probability of changing polarization in time dt is T * dt
