# Dissertaion Meeting Notes: Active Solids

## Blake Denziger
### Patrick Piezonka and Till Welker



# February 28 Meeting

- Density plots: position density and polar order (pick a radius and calculate average spin)
- Eventually do it as an animation
- Can plot polarity as color on a 1d hist with height as position density
- Implement orientation correlation and mean squared density
