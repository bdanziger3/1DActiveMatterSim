# TODO Notes


## June 18

Changed Python code to load data files that have `snapshot_dt != dt`. But still have to check that it works




- Check that can animate data files that have `snapshot_dt != dt` and that fps of animations work as expected.



## June 23

- Fix extending of simulations to combine SimulationData objects to efficiently read and do correlation functions on extended sims.

- Run longer sims on larger boxes and do MSD and polar order on them



## July 14

Convert old serialized files to new serialization method.
